          <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br>
          Nestled in the Karnali Province of Nepal, particularly in the Sija River area of Jumla district, lies a region regarded as one of the world's oldest examples of natural beauty, cultural heritage, artistic prowess, and craftsmanship. This area is rich in history, encompassing temples, literature, language, art, architecture, sculpture, and folk traditions.
          
<br>Historically, this region was once a prosperous and advanced kingdom, but today it stands as a distinct part of Nepal. Known as the "Golden Land of the Khas Mandal," it stretches from the Trishuli River westward.

Historical records suggest that six generations of
rulers after King Ashok Challa centralized their
governance in Sija, forming the extensive Khas
Empire. This legacy marked the area as a significant
region of Nepal, spurring the establishment of
various initiatives for enterprise development.
Initially, the region spanned areas like Mansarovar Bay and parts of Tibet's Gangne province.
Nagraj, in 1207 B.S (1150 A.D), is believed to have founded the Khas Kingdom from Tibet's Khadi
Province, then referred to as Jaleshwar. This beautiful region is characterized by a flowing river and
fertile lands. It produces indigenous crops like Marsi rice, apples, beans, soybeans, peaches, and
walnuts at an altitude of approximately 3,050meters. Above these farmlands lie pastures and
meadows, where cattle graze. Beyond the settlements,vast forests and high-altitude plateaus host
valuable medicinal herbs such as Yarsagumba, Guchi mushrooms, Shilajit, and Hathe Kanchi.
The area holds historical importance, with rulers like Ashoka Challa, King Krichal, the Pal Dynasty,
Nagraj, the Samudra Dynasty, the Surya Pal Dynasty, Sangraha Malla, Jitari Malla, Jalandari Malla,
and Ripu Malla contributing to its legacy. Referred to as the "Golden Seat of Civilization," Sija's
cultural and historical richness is unmatched.The region has become a hub
for comprehensive enterprise
development, attracting visitors
from around the globe. Tourists
come to experience its unique
blend of Hindu traditions, Khas
culture, traditional attire,
dialects, and cuisine. To the
north lies Mugu district,
approximately 100 kilometers
away, home to Rara Lake—Nepal’s largest and most stunning natural lake. This pristine destination
attracts thousands of domestic and international tourists each year, who enjoy its serene beauty
through boating and photography.<br><br>

<strong>Climate and Seasonal Diversity</strong><br>
Due to climate change,
cooler regions like Sija
valley are gaining
popularity. The area's
climate varies significantly
by season. In winter
(December–January),
temperatures range is from
-5°C to -8°C, with snow
covering the hills,
mountains, and valleys.
Despite the cold, the local community remains well-adapted to the conditions.<br><br>
Spring (March–April) brings moderate temperatures of 18°C to 25°C. During this time,
apple trees blossom and other flowering trees bloom, creating a picturesque and

productive landscape. By monsoon (June–September), the fields turn lush and green,
and crops like rice and wheat are ready for harvest. Autumn (October–November)
showcases a vibrant natural palette, with nutritious fruits and health promoting herbs

contributing to peoples’ livelihoods taking advantage of enabling and pleasant weather ideal for exploration of nature’s contribution to people. With the melting of snow in highaltitude peaks and plateaus around mid-April, the region becomes a treasure trove of
valuable product –a unique -half herb and half fungus- product locally called
<u>Yarsagumbo</u> (<i>Ophiocordyceps sinensis</i>). Naturally, found between 3,800 and 4,600
meters in the high Himalayas, this medicinal herb-cum-fungus is highly sought after
globally, fetching prices between NPR 3.6 million (USD 26,506) and NPR 4 million
(USD 29,451) per kilogram.<br><br>

organize in the form of an annual festival with rich tourists and prospecting business
people often traveling by helicopter to participate in the festival to gain an experience.
